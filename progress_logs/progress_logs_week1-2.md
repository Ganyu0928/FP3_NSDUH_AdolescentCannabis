# Week 1-2 Progress log
This week focused on setting up the project, accessing data, identifying variables, and reviewing NSDUH documentation. I completed the initial GitHub repository structure and identified all key variables required for the adolescent cannabis analysis.

## Tasks
### Week 1 (Prep Work)
- Reviewed the 2023 NSDUH documentation and codebook.
- Identified variables for the FP3 project:
  - Perceived marijuana risk (RSKMRJWK)
  - Past 30-day marijuana use (MJDAY30A)
  - Demographics (sex, age groups, race/ethnicity)
- Confirmed coding schemes and response categories.
- Created the initial GitHub repository and organized folders.

### Week 2 (Data Cleaning)
- Loaded the raw NSDUH dataset and restricted the sample to adolescents ages 12–17.
- Recoded key variables into usable formats (factors/labels).
- Cleaned invalid or missing responses based on codebook rules.
- Ran basic checks on frequencies and missingness.
- Saved the cleaned dataset in data_clean/.
- Updated the data cleaning script and pushed changes to GitHub.
