# Week 3 Progress Log
This week I ran all descriptive and bivariate analyses using the cleaned NSDUH adolescent dataset from Week 1–2. I checked frequency tables, cross-tabulations, and row-percentage summaries to describe perceived risk, marijuana use, and covariables. All results were exported for use in Week 4 modeling.

## Tasks 
- Loaded the cleaned adolescent dataset (nsduh_2023_clean.Rdata).
- Reviewed variable structure using `str()` and `head()` to confirm recodes from Week 1–2.
- Created frequency tables for:
  - Perceived marijuana risk (RSKMRJWK)
  - Past 30-day marijuana use (MJDAY30A)
  - Sex (IRSEX)
- Produced cross-tabulations:
  - Perceived risk × marijuana use  
- Calculated row percentages to show proportional differences across risk groups.
- Exported descriptive tables to the output/ folder.
- Updated the script 02_descriptive_analysis.R and pushed all outputs to GitHub.
